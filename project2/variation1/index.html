    <p>The Rose That Grew From Concrete</p>
    <br>
    <p>Did you hear about the rose that grew</p>
    <p>from a crack in the concrete?</p>
    <p>Proving nature's law is wrong it</p>
    <p>learned to walk with out having feet.</p>
    <p>Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams,</p>
    <p>it learned to breathe fresh air.</p>
    <p>Long live the rose that grew from concrete</p>
    <p>when no one else ever cared.</p>
